## Overview

Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. This project provides hands-on experience in managing users, groups, and policies in a centralized manner. It also includes practical exercises for configuring domains, organizational units (OUs), and access permissions.

## Objectives

- Understand the structure and components of Active Directory.
- Configure a domain controller on Windows Server.
- Create and manage users, groups, and OUs.
- Implement Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for security and resource management.
- Integrate AD with network services like DNS and DHCP.

## Features

- **Domain Controller Setup** – Installing and promoting a Windows Server as a domain controller.
- **User and Group Management** – Creating users, groups, and managing permissions.
- **Organizational Units (OUs)** – Structuring the directory for efficient management.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** – Automating security settings and configurations.
- **DNS Integration** – Ensuring proper domain name resolution in the network.

## Technologies Used

- **Operating System:** Windows Server 2019/2022
- **Tools:** Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), PowerShell
- **Protocols:** LDAP, Kerberos, DNS

## Setup

1. Install Windows Server and configure a static IP address.
2. Install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role.
3. Promote the server to a Domain Controller.
4. Use ADUC or PowerShell to create users, groups, and OUs.
5. Apply GPOs for managing security and access control.
